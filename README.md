# A Beamer template for UGE/Inria

## Why this repository ?
The official template of the University is not convenient enough.
For a long time, LaTeX/Beamer users were forgotten.

Since we are a common team, we have to switch between our two institutes templates regularly.


## What is it ?
The purpose of this LaTeX/Beamer theme is to provide a template for presentations at Université Gustave Eiffel or Inria.


## Warning
!!! This not an official template !!! 

Despite our efforts, we are not respecting *strictly* the graphical charter, we prioritized ergonomic and reading solutions.
However, thanks to Oliver FRANÇOIS, an official Beamer template, respecting graphical charter, can be found at: https://intranet.univ-eiffel.fr/communication/logos-et-documents-chartes .
Many other PowerPoint materials can also be found at the previous link.

But our template is much more convenient and prettier.
